Constraints
===========
    For scientific and analyze uses, this application is orientated to various 
    users(biologists) all over the world. Before developing the project, we have 
    to take some main constraints into account so that we can come up any useful ideas
    to deal with them in the future. 
Space Complexity
----------------
    Not only the time complexity should be considered, but also the space complexity.
    There are two aspects for space complexity. One is the size of the whole web 
    application. **The application should not larger than 1GB.**
    Applications should not take up too much CPU and storage space,it should be run in almost all compters. 


Intelligent processing
----------------------
    User's data can be processed in the background when the computer CPU is idle.

Application inclusiveness
-------------------------
    Users can connecting devices to applications,so they can easily upload data.
    And it can connect with other applications,such browser,wps and so on.
